Buoyant plume theory coupled with Rutgers ROMS.

This repository contains code of the Buoyant Plume Theory (BPT)/ROMS Coupled Model. Previously the model is developed based on Kate's ROMS branch (ROMS-ice) in order to allow coupling with sea-ice model.

However, Kate's ROMS is heavily modified and contains a lot of uniform configurations, which is potentially buggy. Since so far we haven't get the chance to couple the model with sea-ice, it is reasonable to migrate back to Rutgers ROMS to maintain a tidy version of the code.
